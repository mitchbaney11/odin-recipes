    <p><em>"The Sage of Ire was known for his brusque Way
        of speaking, and complete disregard for other's feelings.
        He did however cure many diseases, so this drink is to honor
        his work.
    </em></p>

    <p>The Sage of Ire is a drink that really just puts you in 
        horrible mood. You will hate everyone around you, 
        and witty retorts and cutting insults will be at 
        the tip of your tongue.
